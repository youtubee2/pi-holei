# Automated Install 
##### Designed For Raspberry Pi A+, B, B+, 2, and Zero (with an Ethernet/Wi-Fi adapter)
>>>>>>> ScriptCleanup

1. Install Raspbian on Raspberry Pi variants or a Debian based distribution on other hardware or virtual machines
2. Run the command below

### ```curl -L https://install.pi-hole.net | bash```

#### Alternative Semi-Automated install ####
```
wget -O basic-install.sh https://install.pi-hole.net
chmod +x basic-install.sh
./basic-install.sh
```

Once installed, [configure your router to have **DHCP clients use the Pi as their DNS server**](http://pi-hole.net/faq/can-i-set-the-pi-hole-to-be-the-dns-server-at-my-router-so-i-dont-have-to-change-settings-for-my-devices/) and then any device that connects to your network will have ads blocked without any further configuration.  Alternatively, you can manually set each device to [use the Raspberry Pi as its DNS server](http://pi-hole.net/faq/how-do-i-use-the-pi-hole-as-my-dns-server/).

## Partnering With Optimal.com

Pi-hole will be teaming up with [Rob Leathern's subscription service to avoid ads](https://medium.com/@robleathern/block-ads-on-all-home-devices-for-53-18-a5f1ec139693#.gj1xpgr5d).  This service is unique and will help content-creators and publishers [still make money from visitors who are using an ad ablocker](http://techcrunch.com/2015/12/17/the-new-optimal/).

## Technical Details

The Pi-hole is an **advertising-aware DNS/Web server**.  If an ad domain is queried, a small Web page or GIF is delivered in place of the advertisement.  You can also [replace ads with any image you want](http://pi-hole.net/faq/is-it-possible-to-change-the-blank-page-that-takes-place-of-the-ads-to-something-else/) since it is just a simple Webpage taking place of the ads.

A more detailed explanation of the installation can be found [here](http://jacobsalmela.com/block-millions-ads-network-wide-with-a-raspberry-pi-hole-2-0).

## Gravity
The [gravity.sh](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/gravity.sh) does most of the magic.  The script pulls in ad domains from many sources and compiles them into a single list of [over 1.6 million entries](http://jacobsalmela.com/block-millions-ads-network-wide-with-a-raspberry-pi-hole-2-0) (if you decide to use the [mahakala list](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/commit/963eacfe0537a7abddf30441c754c67ca1e40965)).

## Whitelist and blacklist
Domains can be whitelisted and blacklisted using two pre-installed scripts. See [the wiki page](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/wiki/Whitelisting-and-Blacklisting) for more details

## Web Interface
The [Web interface](https://github.com/jacobsalmela/AdminLTE#pi-hole-admin-dashboard) will be installed automatically so you can view stats and change settings.  You can find it at:

`http://192.168.1.x/admin/index.php`

### API

A basic read-only API can be accessed at `/admin/api.php`. It returns the following JSON:
```JSON
{
	"domains_being_blocked": "136708",
	"dns_queries_today": "18108",
	"ads_blocked_today": "14648",
	"ads_percentage_today": "80.89"
}
```
The same output can be acheived on the CLI by running `chronometer.sh -j`

## Real-time Statistics

You can view [real-time stats](http://pi-hole.net/faq/install-the-real-time-lcd-monitor-chronometer/) via `ssh` or on an [2.8" LCD screen](http://amzn.to/1P0q1Fj).  This is accomplished via [`chronometer.sh`](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/advanced/Scripts/chronometer.sh).

## Help
- See the [Wiki](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/wiki/Customization) entry for more details
- There is also an [FAQ section on pi-hole.net](http://pi-hole.net)

## Other Operating Systems
This script will work for other UNIX-like systems with some slight **modifications**.  As long as you can install `dnsmasq` and a Webserver, it should work OK.  The automated install is only for a clean install of a Debian based system, such as the Raspberry Pi.
