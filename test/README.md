# How do I test?

Make sure you have Docker and Python w/pip package manager.

From command line all you need to do is:

- `pip install tox`
- `tox`

# How do I debug python?

Highly recommended: Setup PyCharm on a **Docker enabled** machine.  Having a python debugger like PyCharm changes your life if you've never used it :)
